oauth2-code-proxy is a Google App Engine service that proxies the OAuth 2.0
access token request, adding the required the client authentication to the
request.

The motivation is to be able to use a service that does not support the
implicit grant request in a mobile application without including the client
secret in the mobile application.

This, of course, does not solve the problem of being hijacked.  Instead of
stealing the client secret to gain access tokens, the hijacker could just
use this proxy.  (The authorization page should say which application is
being authorized, so a hijacker that doesn't even try to impersonate the
real application will look fishy.)

Another concern is that the access tokens will be seen by the proxy, rather
than being sent directly to the mobile application.  (Of course, the
application could also then send the access token to some server.)  This
proxy, insofar as possible on Google App Engine, does not log or record the
access tokens.
